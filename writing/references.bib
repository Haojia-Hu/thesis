This paper focuses on U.S. residential real estate, where many homeowners have fixed mortgage rates well below prevailing rates. Findings reveal that each percentage point that market rates exceed existing fixed rates reduces sale probability by 18.1\%. This lock-in prevented 1.72 million transactions from 2022Q2 to 2024Q2 and increased home prices by 7.0\%. Lock-in restricts mobility, results in people not living in homes they would prefer, inflates prices, and exacerbates economic inequality.},

We observe both absolute declines and declines relative to homeowners without mortgages, who are unaffected by mortgage rate lock. Mobility declines are not explained by changes in home values.

	abstract = {Rising interest rates in 2022 introduced large moving costs for homeowners with low, ﬁxed-rate mortgages. Using a novel dataset linking mortgage loans, consumer credit proﬁles, and property sales, we examine the eﬀects of rate hikes on household mobility and the broader economic impacts of the resulting mortgage rate lock-in. As market rates rise relative to those on borrowers’ existing loans, likelihood of moving falls with the highest elasticity among borrowers just “in the money.” Our results suggest about 44\% of the decline in moves among mortgage holders between 2021 and 2022 may be attributable to the widening gap between borrower’s existing and market rates. We ﬁnd limited scope for labor misallocation due to lock-in, as moves across labor market areas are rather unaﬀected. Instead, lock-in primarily reduces within-metro churn and moves up the housing ladder, leading to fewer real estate listings and greater house price growth. We explain lock-in-driven price increases through a housing search model: in a seller’s market, reduced churn raises market tightness, driving up prices. Consistent with such a model, we show measures of market tightness increase in response to lockin, with the most signiﬁcant eﬀects in markets that were already tight.},

	doi = {10.2139/ssrn.5075679},
	abstract = {How do non-assumable ﬁxed-rate mortgages affect the transmission of interest rates into house prices? Higher rates increase the value of existing ﬁxed-rate debt, creating an asymmetry between buyers and existing owners. We use administrative data to study the effect of this asymmetry on existing-home prices and sales during the 2021-23 tightening cycle. Using unexpected increases in the long-term Treasury rate, we ﬁnd that existing owners value low-rate mortgages: lower ﬁxed rates reduce sales, discourage moves from owning to renting, and increase existing owners’ willingness to accept. This causes higher price growth in local housing markets where existing mortgages become more valuable during tightening. For variation in the local mortgage distribution, we develop new instruments based on family size shocks that cause moves in periods with different long-term rates. Our estimates imply that eliminating the value of existing ﬁxed-rate mortgages would reverse 30\% of 2021-23 house price growth. We estimate a structural model of dynamic housing demand to measure the net price effect of higher rates, which both increase the value of existing ﬁxed-rate debt and discourage homeownership. Existing models without ﬁxed-rate mortgages predict a 20-37\% price decline due to 2021-23 tightening. We predict a 4\% decrease. Fixed-rate mortgages thus attenuate negative price effects of rate hikes, but do not explain 2021-23 price growth.},

The resulting environment amplifies transmission from interest rates into debt, house prices, and economic activity. Monetary policy more easily stabilizes inflation, but contributes to larger fluctuations in credit growth. A relaxation of payment-to-income standards appears vital for explaining the recent boom. A cap on payment-to-income ratios, not loan-to-value ratios, is the more effective macroprudential policy for limiting boom-bust cycles.},

	abstract = {The last two recessions in the United States, linked with the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the COVID-19 Pandemic, respectively, caused huge swings in the housing market – but with opposing signs. The GFC was associated with a historic collapse in housing prices, while COVID saw a rapid appreciation. These divergent responses occurred against the background of large scale conventional and unconventional monetary policy and fiscal stimulus in both episodes. With the GFC as a well-studied reference point, we focus on the COVID period and argue that the nature of the shock and macro stability conditions resulted in substantially different housing market outcomes. The pandemic generated a positive demand shock for housing, and strong household balance sheets supported borrowing at the low rates available. However, the COVID housing boom also broadly locked in low rates for existing homeowners. While the rapid rise in mortgage rates that followed increased the cost of ownership at the margin, the lock-in reduced the supply of housing for sale and perpetuated higher prices. We use a transparent modeling framework to illustrate and quantify these dynamics. As long as legacy borrowers remain locked to lower rates, monetary policy transmission is subverted, since higher rates lead to greater lock-in and reduced supply.},

abstract = {In this paper, we extend and calibrate with Italian data the Agent-based model of the real estate sector described in Baptista et al., 2016. We design a novel calibration methodology that is built on a multivariate moment-based measure and a set of three search algorithms: a low discrepancy series, a machine learning surrogate and a genetic algorithm. The calibrated and validated model is then used to evaluate the effects of three hypothetical borrower-based macroprudential policies: an 80 per cent loan-to-value cap, a 30 per cent cap on the loan-service-to-income ratio and a combination of both policies. We find that, within our framework, these policy interventions tend to slow down the credit cycle and reduce the probability of defaults on mortgages. However, with respect to the Italian housing market, we only find very small effects over a five-year horizon on both property prices and mortgage defaults. This latter result is consistent with the view that the Italian household sector is financially sound. Finally, we find that restrictive policies lead to a shift in demand toward lower quality dwellings.},
