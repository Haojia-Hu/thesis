# Transformed Data：Category-level CPI

This folder contains **monthly CPI index series by consumption category**
constructed from raw BLS CPI Excel files.

These datasets are **analysis-ready transformed inputs**
used prior to constructing price changes, price volatility,
and regression panels in Chapter 1.

## Construction script

All files in this folder are generated by:

code/ch01/03_expectation_formation/03_ingest_cpi_category.R

## Output files

Processed CPI series are written to this folder using the naming convention:

<Category>_cpi.csv


Examples:
- `Apparel_cpi.csv`
- `Education_cpi.csv`
- `Energy_cpi.csv`
- `Housing_cpi.csv`

## File structure

Each output file contains:

| Column | Description |

| `Date` | Monthly date (`YYYY-MM-01`) |
| `Product` | Consumption category |
| `CPI` | CPI index level |

The sample period extends through **December 2024**.

## Role in the Chapter 1 pipeline

Category-level CPI series in this folder are used to construct:

- category-level price changes
- category-level price volatility

These derived price measures are then merged with attention indices
and control variables to form the final regression panels
used in Local Projection analyses.
