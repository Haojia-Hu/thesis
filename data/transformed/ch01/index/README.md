# Transformed Data: Attention Index

This directory stores category-level attention indices constructed
from raw Google Trends data.

Files in this directory are generated by:
- code/ch01/01_index/01_build_attention_index.R

Each output file has the form:
- <category>_index.csv

These files are generated locally and are not tracked in the repository.


## Additional Transformations

Beyond the original attention indices stored in this directory which are generated by:
- code/ch01/01_index/03_detrend_and_difference.R;
subsequent transformations are applied as part of the Chapter 1 analysis pipeline.

Specifically:

- `residual/`:
  Attention indices after removing a quadratic time trend and month fixed effects.
  These residual series capture short- and medium-run fluctuations in consumer attention.

- `diff/`:
  First differences of the residual attention indices.
  These series are treated as stationary inputs for regression and local projection analyses.

All transformed series are generated locally and are reproducible using the scripts
in `code/ch01/01_index/`.
