Housing-Market Quantities: First-Stage Objects

This folder contains intermediate, analysis-ready objects used for the Chapter 2 main
empirical results on housing-market activity and the lock-in channel.

All files are generated by:
- `code/ch02/05_housing_quant/01_first_stage_rategap_hat.R`

Key identifiers:
- `cbsa_code` (5-digit CBSA)
- `ym` (YYYY-MM)

## Panel_rategap_hat.csv

**Purpose**  
Create the CBSA-by-month estimation panel used in the **first-stage** regression that
relates the observed mortgage rate gap to the Bartik instrument and controls.

**Inputs**
- Rate gap: `data/transformed/ch02/rate_gap/Rate_gap_monthly.csv`
- Bartik IV: `data/transformed/ch02/iv/SS_IV.csv` (uses `Z_bartik_level` by default)
- Controls:
  - `laus_unemployment_msa.csv`
  - `cbsa_migration_monthly.csv`
  - `bps_cbsa_monthly.csv`
  (all under `data/transformed/ch02/control_variables/`)

**Specification (first stage)**  
`rate_gap ~ Z_bartik + unemployment_rate + mig_rate_month + bps_total`
with CBSA and month fixed effects, and standard errors clustered by CBSA.

**Key columns**
- `rate_gap` : observed mortgage rate gap (percentage points)
- `Z_bartik` : Bartik instrument (Exposure × NatShock)
- `unemployment_rate`, `mig_rate_month`, `bps_total` : controls
- `rategap_hat` : fitted value from the first-stage FE regression
- `rategap_resid` : first-stage residual (diagnostic)

**Time coverage**
- **January 2018 – December 2024** (monthly)

## Rategap_hat_singleIV.csv

**Purpose**  
Provide the fitted (instrumented) rate gap series used as the endogenous regressor input
in downstream IV specifications (e.g., 2SLS outcome regressions and LP-IV).

**Columns**
- `cbsa_code`
- `ym`
- `rategap_hat`

**Time coverage**
- **January 2018 – December 2024** (monthly)

## Notes

- These outputs are upstream of the final outcome panel that merges Zillow housing-market
  indicators. They are designed to merge cleanly on (`cbsa_code`, `ym`).
- The first-stage residual is included in `Panel_rategap_hat.csv` for diagnostics and robustness checks.
