# Local Projection Outputs — Baseline Specification 

This folder contains **baseline Local Projection (LP) results** for Chapter 1.
All outputs are generated by the script:
- code/ch01/03_expectation_formation/05_local_projection_baseline.R

The baseline specification estimates horizon-specific responses of
inflation expectations to category-level price signals and household attention,
using monthly category-panel data.

---

## Input data

The LP regressions use the following input dataset:

- `data/transformed/ch01/panel/panel_data.csv`

This panel contains monthly observations (2004-01 to 2024-12) by consumption
category, including:
- first-differenced attention indices
- category-level price change and price volatility measures
- interaction terms between attention and price signals
- differenced macroeconomic controls

## Output files

### 1. Regression coefficient outputs

- **`irf_baseline.csv`**

  Contains estimated Local Projection impulse response functions (IRFs)
  for selected regressors across horizons \( h = 1,\dots,12 \).

  Columns include:
  - `spec`: specification label (`baseline`)
  - `term`: regressor name  
    (e.g., `L1_diff_index`, `Interaction_PC`, `Interaction_Vol`)
  - `h`: horizon (months ahead)
  - `estimate`: coefficient estimate
  - `std.error`: standard error
  - `conf.low`, `conf.high`: 95% confidence interval bounds

- **`coef_path_baseline.csv`**

  Contains the full set of estimated coefficients from each LP regression,
  across all horizons and all regressors. This file is primarily used for
  diagnostic checks and robustness comparisons.

### 2. Figures

The following figures visualize the estimated IRFs from the baseline LP
specification:

- **`fig_irf_attention.png`**  
  IRF of lagged household attention on inflation expectations.

- **`fig_irf_interaction_pc.png`**  
  IRF of the interaction between household attention and price changes.

- **`fig_irf_interaction_vol.png`**  
  IRF of the interaction between household attention and price volatility.

- **`fig_irf_interactions_pc_vs_vol.png`**  
  Combined IRF plot comparing the two interaction effects:
  attention × price change versus attention × price volatility.

All figures display point estimates with 95% confidence intervals.

## Notes

- All LP regressions include **category fixed effects**.
- Horizon-specific dependent variables are constructed within category
  to avoid cross-category lead contamination.
- This folder contains only **baseline results**. Alternative specifications
  and robustness checks are stored in separate subfolders under:
