# 2SLS Housing Price

This folder contains regression outputs for the Chapter 2 house price analysis using 2SLS.

## The module purpose
We estimate 2SLS models of CBSA-level monthly house price growth on the local mortgage rate gap.
The endogenous regressor is `rate_gap`, instrumented by `Z_bartik`. All specifications include
CBSA fixed effects and month fixed effects, with standard errors clustered at the CBSA level.

In addition to the baseline 2SLS model, we run a set of robustness checks that vary the sample
and specification following the analysis script.

## Inputs (from data/transformed/ch02)
1. Zillow house prices (ZHVI)
- data/transformed/ch02/zillow/zillow_zhvi.csv
Used to construct monthly house price growth:
`price_chg = 100 * (log(ZHVI_t) - log(ZHVI_{t-1}))`.

2. Core CBSA-month panel (RateGap, IV, and controls)
- data/transformed/ch02/housing_quant/panel_rategap_hat.csv
Contains `rate_gap`, `Z_bartik`, and time-varying controls such as unemployment rate,
migration rate, and building permits.

3. Zillow housing quantity proxy (new listings)
- data/transformed/ch02/zillow/zillow_newlisting.csv
Used to construct a logged lock-in proxy (`proxy_newlist`), primarily for consistency
with the broader Chapter 2 data pipeline.

## Outputs
1. housing_price_2sls_baseline_and_robustness.csv
A tidy table that records the estimated 2SLS coefficient on `rate_gap` and key statistics
for:
- Baseline 2SLS
- Baseline + lagged dependent variable
- Trimmed sample (5–95 percentiles of rate gap) [as implemented in code]
- High-gap vs low-gap subsamples (split at the sample median) [as implemented in code]
- COVID vs hiking-period subsamples [as implemented in code]

2. housing_price_2sls_models.rds (optional)
Serialized `fixest` model objects for reproducibility and for producing LaTeX tables
without rerunning regressions.

## Reproducibility

# Local Projection IV (Dynamic Effects)

In addition to the static 2SLS specifications, we estimate dynamic responses of house price growth to RateGap shocks using Local Projection IV (LP-IV).

## The LP specification estimates, for horizons h = 0 to 12 months:

    price_chg_{t+h} = β_h * RateGap_t  (IV: Z_bartik)
                      + controls
                      + CBSA FE
                      + Month FE
                      + ε_{t+h}

where:
- price_chg = 100 * Δlog(ZHVI)
- rate_gap is instrumented by Z_bartik
- Standard errors are clustered at the CBSA level
- Month FE uses ym (YYYY-MM)

The LP estimates correspond to non-cumulative impulse responses (month-by-month price growth response).

## Outputs (LP-IV)

# Heterogeneity Analysis (LP-IV)

In addition to the baseline and dynamic specifications, we estimate heterogeneous responses of house prices to RateGap shocks along two structural dimensions:

Local labor market strength (employment growth)

Housing supply elasticity (Saiz 2010)

## 1. Heterogeneity by Employment Growth

CBSA areas are split by the median of average employment growth (2018–2024), constructed from QCEW county-level data aggregated to CBSA level.

High Employment Growth: CBSA average employment growth above median
Low Employment Growth: CBSA average employment growth below median

Outputs:

lp_price_hetero_employment.csv
Contains, for each horizon h = 0–12:

• Estimated coefficient on rate_gap
• Clustered standard error
• 95% confidence interval
• Group label

## 2. Heterogeneity by Supply Elasticity (Saiz 2010)

CBSA areas are split by the median housing supply elasticity (Saiz 2010).

High Supply Elasticity: More flexible housing supply
Low Supply Elasticity: More constrained housing supply

Outputs:

lp_price_hetero_supply_elasticity.csv
Impulse response estimates by elasticity group.
