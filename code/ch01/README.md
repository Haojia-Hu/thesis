Code for Chapter 1.

# Chapter 1 – Household Attention, Price Signals, and Inflation Expectations

This folder contains all code used for **Chapter 1** of the dissertation, which
studies the dynamics of household attention and its interaction with price
signals in shaping inflation expectations.

The code is organized into three main components:
1. Construction of attention indices
2. Analysis of attention cycles
3. Local Projection analysis of expectation formation

Each subfolder contains its own README with detailed documentation.

## 1. Attention index construction (`01_index/`)

This folder contains scripts that construct category-level **attention indices**
from Google Trends data.

Key tasks include:
- Ingesting raw Google Trends keyword data
- Standardizing and aggregating search intensity
- Constructing category-level attention indices

Outputs are written to:
data/transformed/ch01/index/


See:
- `code/ch01/01_index/README.md`

---

## 2. Attention cycle analysis (`02_attention_cycles/`)

This folder analyzes the **dynamic properties of attention**, including:
- Detrending and deseasonalization
- First differencing
- AR-based cycle detection
- Frequency-domain analysis (FFT, rolling FFT)
- Clustering of categories based on attention dynamics

Key outputs include:
- Cycle diagnostics
- FFT-based clustering results used in heterogeneity analysis

Outputs are written to:
data/transformed/ch01/attention_cycle/


See:
- `code/ch01/02_attention_cycles/README.md`

---

## 3. Expectation formation and Local Projections (`03_expectation_formation/`)

This folder contains all scripts related to the **Local Projection (LP) analysis**
linking attention, price signals, and inflation expectations.

It includes:
- Ingestion and processing of macroeconomic, CPI, and news controls
- Construction of category-level panel datasets
- Baseline LP estimation
- Extensive robustness checks
- Heterogeneity analysis by attention-cycle clusters

Key outputs are written to:
data/output/ch01/local_projection/


See:
- `code/ch01/03_expectation_formation/README.md`

---

## Recommended execution order

To fully reproduce Chapter 1 results:

1. Construct attention indices (`01_index/`)
2. Analyze attention cycles and clustering (`02_attention_cycles/`)
3. Build panel data and run Local Projections (`03_expectation_formation/`)

Each subfolder README provides a detailed execution order and input/output
description.

## Notes

- Raw data files are **not tracked** in this repository.
- All transformed data and output files are generated by the scripts in this
  folder.
- The code is written to be modular and reproducible; robustness checks and
  heterogeneity analyses can be extended without modifying baseline scripts.
