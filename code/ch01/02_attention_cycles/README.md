# Chapter 1 - Attention Cycles Analysis

This directory contains all scripts used to analyze cyclical dynamics and
short-term predictability in category-level household attention for Chapter 1
of the dissertation.

All analyses in this directory operate on first-differenced attention indices
constructed in `code/ch01/01_index/` and stored under
`data/transformed/ch01/index/`.

The outputs generated by these scripts are analysis-level data products stored
under `data/transformed/ch01/attention_cycles/`, with figures saved separately
under `data/output/ch01/figures/`.

## Script Overview and Execution Order

The analysis pipeline consists of three main steps, implemented in the
following scripts. These scripts are designed to be run sequentially.

---

### 1. AR-Based Cycle Detection  
**Script:** `01_ar_cycle_detection.R`

This script provides time-domain evidence on cyclical dynamics in household
attention using univariate autoregressive (AR) models estimated on
first-differenced attention indices.

Main tasks:
- Select AR lag order for each consumption category using BIC
- Test for the presence of cyclical dynamics based on AR characteristic roots
- Compute implied cycle periods (in months)

Key outputs:
- `ar_cycle_summary.csv`

These results form the AR-based evidence reported in Table 2 of the paper.

---

### 2. AR Forecasts and Short-Term Predictability  
**Script:** `02_ar_forecast.R`

This script evaluates whether household attention exhibits short-term
predictability by generating out-of-sample forecasts from univariate AR
models.

Main tasks:
- Estimate AR models using lag orders selected by BIC
- Generate 12-month-ahead forecasts for each category
- Construct forecast confidence intervals
- Produce forecast plots for visualization

Key outputs:
- `forecasts/*_ar_forecast.csv`
- Forecast figures saved under `data/output/ch01/figures/`

These forecasts are used to assess predictability rather than to build a
forecasting system.

### 3. Frequency-Domain and Rolling FFT Analysis  
**Script:** `03_fft_and_clustering.R`

This script provides frequency-domain evidence on attention cycles and examines
heterogeneity in cyclical dynamics across consumption categories.

Main tasks:
- Compute FFT-based power spectra for each category
- Identify dominant and secondary cycle periods
- Estimate rolling-window FFT to capture time variation in cycle length
- Summarize rolling cycle properties (mean, volatility, trend)
- Cluster categories based on rolling FFT features

Key outputs:
- `fft_cycle_summary.csv`
- `rolling_fft_results.csv`
- `rolling_fft_cluster_results.csv`

These results support the frequency-domain evidence in Table 2 and the
heterogeneity analysis in Section 5.3, including Figure 4.

## Notes

- All scripts in this directory rely on first-differenced attention indices as
  inputs and assume stationarity at short horizons.
- The scripts are modular but interdependent; running them in the listed order
  ensures consistent inputs and outputs.
- Figures produced by these scripts are for visualization and presentation
  purposes only and are not used as inputs for subsequent analysis steps.

For a description of the data products generated by these scripts, see:
`data/transformed/ch01/attention_cycles/README.md`.
